# Starter Guide - How to change my name?

When you first join the server you are tasked with making your own nickname. Of course you may look back at it and desire to change it. There are a few ways to do it, all listed here.


#1 Username Change Token

When first join the server you receive a free username change token. If you had already used it, you can buy another one in the Store

To use the token, navigate to your interaction menu (M on keyboard, left middle button on controller) and press Account.

There you will have the option to change your nickname using the token.


#2 Premium Membership

Premium members have the ability to change their nickname without using a name change token during their membership. After it expires, your changed name will stay and will not be rolled back.


#3 Support Ticket

You can open a support ticket to change your nickname if a small typo occurred or you want to add/remove a crew tag. This method is free, however it doesn't allow for full nickname changes, only for ones listed above.
