# Starter Guide - Crews

To explore crews, please join discord.gg/cnr . Once you are a verified player on the server, you can find posts in the Crews channel recruiting for their groups. Alternatively you can just DM its leader on discord. After joining, an authorized member of the crew [typically owner] can open a ticket asking admins to give you your crew tag, or you can do it yourself either via ticket or name change token/membership. If the Crew is closed, find its members and play with them in-game as this raises your chances of an invite.

To create a crew you need a crew tag, for example TAGHERE x Username, [TAGHERE] Username, TAGHERE | Username and etc.
Whenever you want to add members to it, just create a ticket in the cnr discord, add them to it and ping Admins for a name change, or get them to change their own name with a rename token or membership.
