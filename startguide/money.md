# Starter Guide - Basic Money Making

#### Daily Check!

Everyone on the server will recieve a daily check from the server for playing. This is given once an in-game day at 12:00PM (Noon). This will be sent to your bank account. Amount varies on what role you are playing as on the server.

#### Complete tasks for your role

Criminals (default role) earn money by robbing AI peds and shops, stealing cars and exporting or scraping them, killing most wanted players for bounties or by hacking ATMs. Police Officers earn money by arresting players, bribing players, or killing most wanted players. Paramedics earn money by reviving players and healing players. Drug Dealers earn money by selling drugs.

#### Checking Your Balance
Tap 'Z' or d-pad down to display your balance, which will appear on the top right hand side of the screen. You will notice two different currencies.

The dark green (top) is your wallet. The light green (bottom) is your bank account. You can access your bank account by visiting any ATM machine on the map.

If you have money in your account, hospital bills and bail will be billed through your account, not your wallet. Try to keep a positive balance in your account if possible to avoid incurring debt.

You can also check your balance by typing in "**how much money**" in the chat

#### Lottery tickets

You can purchase scratch lottery tickets (available at LTD or 24/7 shops around the map - shown as **Gas Station** or **Convenience Store**). While it may be obvious, please be aware that winning is based on chance and you are not guaranteed to win it big!

WARNING! Cops and Robbers V does not encourage gambling, follow your local laws. Gambling is addictive.
