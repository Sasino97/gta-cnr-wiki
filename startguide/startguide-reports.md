# Starter Guide - Reporting Players

Note: When reporting a player, the burden of proof is on you and the reported player is innocent until proven guilty.


**METHOD 1 (in-game)** You can report a player in-game via the Help menu. Press M/Select and scroll to the bottom and select 'Help'.

Alternatively, you can also type **/report ID** in the text chat.

**Note:** Please keep the details field as short as possible, only including the important details.

**METHOD 2 (on discord)**

If you have concrete evidence of a rule breaker, you can start a report in the Reports section as long as you are a verified player and not blacklisted. Don't forget to attach a clip!
