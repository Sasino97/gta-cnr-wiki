# Starter Guide - What is Hardcore mode?

CNRV has two types of server: Classic and Hardcore. Classic mode is the standard Cops and Robbers experience, with blips and visible names. In Hardcore mode however you cannot see player blips on the map and names are only visible at close proximity. In addition to that, there are more redzones, and the cooldowns for healing are doubled.

Currently, the only two servers with CNR in hardcore mode are US3 and EU2.
