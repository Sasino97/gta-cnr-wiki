# Starter Guide - Repairing Vehicles
If you get in an accident in your vehicle and don't want to swap it out or send it to maintenance, you can visit a mechanic on the map and repair it for a small fee, this fixes the car's tires, windows, body and engine making it good as new! 
It does not however replenish its fuel, so you have to visit a gas station to fill your tank up. Press 'E' or d-pad right to interact with the mechanic. Note: You must be inside of your vehicle to repair. 
Some vehicle types such as airplanes and helicopters require a special mechanic type to be repaired. Look below for a gif demonstrating this feature.
