# Criminal Guide - Getting Out of Cuffs

When you are cuffed you can hope for one of 3 things:

1. The cop takes a bribe
2. Someone uncuffs you
3. The cop goes away (one way or another)

If the cop goes far enough from you, you will have the opportunity to use a lockpick from your inventory.
When you use it, your handcuffs will break and you will be free! [for now]
