# Criminal Guide - Killing Most Wanted Players
You can kill players with a bounty (5 stars). They appear as a red blip on your map and have a red nameplate. 
Killing them will claim their bounty, however it might also get you in trouble!
As players commit more crimes while most wanted, they will gain a higher bounty.
