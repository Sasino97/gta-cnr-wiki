# Criminal Guide - Drugs
*Jesse, we need to cook*. As a criminal, you can buy drugs from drug dealers. Press **M** or the Select button and go to **Service** to call one to you. Drug Dealers can set their own prices, so prices will vary. **WARNING!** Police Officers can search you while you are cuffed and take all of your illegal drugs. Upon making your call, you should be alerted if any drug dealers received it. Once a drug dealer approaches you, they will offer you drugs. Now you can browse their drugs and choose which drug to purchase and how much. 
Quit the menu when done.  To use drugs, press **M** or the Select button and go to **Inventory** and **Drugs**. Here you can select what drug you would like to use. Effects stack, but keep in mind there is a duration and cooldown, so it's not infinite. You can also overdose and die.
