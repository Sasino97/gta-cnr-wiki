# Criminal Guide - What do I do?
As a jobless outlaw you have surprisingly many options to spend your time on. First, let me show you the scripted activities and then we will move on to the creative stuff.

#### Rob Shops

Around the map you can find lots of different stores you can rob [Hardware/Liquor/Convenience/Clothing Stores, Barber Shops and Restaurants]. Robbing them alone gives you a solid amount of money but robbing them with a buddy who will crack the safe can make your profit go up to the 6 digits per store. When you rob a store, you see an intimidation bar which fills up over time but is sped up by shooting next to the clerk. **Remember that killing the clerk before ending the robbery makes you lose all the profit!**


#### Export/Scrap Vehicles

Some cars give you an option to scrap them at any scrapyard for some cash and others allow you to export them for up to 150K. If you find the most wanted vehicle [/mwveh] you can export it for up to 500K! You export vehicles at the Elysian Island which is a Redzone!

#### Hacking ATMs

When you buy an ATM hacking tool from the Hacker Store at Lester's crib, you can come up to an ATM and hack it for up to 200K!  Remember that the hacking tools can be confiscated by cops when you get searched.


#### Pickpocket

Whenever you see an NPC, you have an option to pickpocket it for a small amount of money. Be aware that some NPCs will attack you when you rob them!
You can also pickpocket players for a higher, albeit riskier reward.


#### Kill Players with Bounties

Whenever a person has a red name, anyone except of Paramedics can shoot them on sight. For killing them you get from 25 to 100K.


#### Join Hold-Ups

Players love taking over places such as Gun Club 1 and defending them from cops. Join them and have some fun playing 3D Tower Defense ;D
