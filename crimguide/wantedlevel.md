# Criminal Guide - Wanted Levels

As you perform activites related to your criminal role, you will gain stars, similar to single player Grand Theft Auto V. 
If you are not threatening NPCs or Players, don't have a gun out and have less than 5 stars cops cannot shoot you, they can only tase and ram you. 
While they can deal damage to you, repeatedly punching you or attacking you might be considered a violation of the rules.
5 (Red) Stars makes you a most wanted suspect. Other criminals can kill you for bounty and officers can kill you as long as you aren't surrendering (on your knees, not just with hands up!!!).
To lose stars, either get arrested by a cop, visit a Police Station and find the Police NPC (interact with the NPC and Select turn yourself in, does not work if you have 5 stars.) 
You can also evade the PD (keep away from cops and crime scenes) and wait for your wanted level to slowly deplete itself, bribe a police officer (does not work if you have 5 stars) or die to reset your WL.
