# Criminal Guide - Revenge
Someone just killed you and now you are mad! Fortunately the revenge list comes to play.
Whenever someone kills, damages or arrests you, you can take revenge on them by killing or attacking them until the game week ends [server restart]. 
To find your revenge list use /revenge. If you want to hire someone to kill your target, you can transfer revenge to them and get them to eliminate your foes. 

**While you can take revenge on people who provoked you/your friends, you need to have proof that it happened in the session.**
