# EMS Guide - Reviving

Approach a player who has been critically wounded. They will be laying on the ground. Their name and DOT on map will be flashing gray. 
Once you are next to them, press 'X' or d-pad up to revive them. It will take you a few seconds as you conduct CPR. 
You are vulnerable while you conduct it and the process cannot be cancelled after getting started. Teaming up with criminals is bannable.

**If you revive someone's opponents, eg. Cops during a Shootout. You can be killed!**
