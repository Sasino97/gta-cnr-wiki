# Cop Guide - Radio
As a cop you gain access to a powerful tool... The Radio! It allows you to call for backup with ease and connect with other Cops. The voice radio requires you to have a microphone, so you can talk to others. 
The Radio by default has the Emergency Channel, this is where most cops and medics call for backup and inform each other on things. 
There is a plethora of other channels, all with notes, so you know which one to use, and when. 
To access the Radio settings **Open the Interaction Menu -> Open the Job Menu -> Open Radio**

**You can also use the radio using the [! yourtext] chat command, then your messages show up in the chat, only for players connected to the radio.**
