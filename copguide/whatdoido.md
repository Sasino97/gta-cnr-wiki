# Cop Guide - What do I do?

Now that you're a cop you have to start doing something. Fortunately we predicted that you may want to participate in different activities and can offer you some examples:

#### Discover your Options

As a cop you have separate weapons and vehicles from criminals or EMS workers. Discover your new tools and check out the radio in the interaction menu [M] [Left Xbox Button]

#### Respond to Calls

When someone is in trouble or a crime is commited you will get an alert that will tell you who did it and where did it occur. By responding to the calls, you earn XP and can provide backup to other cops/arrest the outlaws that commited the crime.

#### Pursue Suspects

That's kind of obvious but vehicular pursuits are really fun and you should give them a try to practice your skills. Chasing suspects in vehicles is a good way to practice ramming, setting up roadblocks and more!

#### Become an Air Unit

Cops often need CAS to deal with dangerous criminals, so hop in that heli and offer air support in the Cop Radio. When a criminal has a bounty [red blip] or is attacking you, NPCs or other players you can utilize brute force ramming tactics to take them down. In other cases you can employ a gunner to help you take criminals down, if you have a passenger give him a clear angle at dangerous crims and let him hop out to deal with non-threatening ones.

#### Bust Drug Dealers

Players can become drug dealers and sell drugs to NPC to make a quick buck. You can make a quick buck by busting them. Most drug dealers operate on the LVL15+ NA2/EU2 servers that have no blips. Crews often go to drug spots in groups, so you need other officers to support you in busting big groups of dealers. You earn money per grams of good stuff seized. '''Drug Dealers are DANGEROUS!''' Most of them will kill themselves or try to take you down just to avoid a bust, be prepared.

#### Take down Robberies
Players can make bank by going around the map robbing different stores, when they rob one they must keep aiming their gun at the NPC to get their money. If a robbery is happening nearby, turn on your lights and get there as soon as you can. If you get lucky, they will be distracted during the robbery and you will be able to tase them with ease. If they open fire, call for backup and take them down.

#### End hold-ups

Players love holding up locations such as Gun Club 1 and defending them like it's a tower defense game. There is often a high amount of red or threatening players in such locations and if you see such an activity, immediately call for backup and find a good spot to take them down utilizing snipers, helis and other vehicles.


There are other things that you can do as a cop, but these are the ones I found the most interesting, 
GOOD LUCK!
