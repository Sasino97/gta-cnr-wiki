# Crimes
Crimes are the illegal actions you commit while you play Cops and Robbers V. Committing crimes causes your wanted level to increase, and the police to be dispatched.

Players on a *public service* job are unable to commit crimes.

## Crime System
Each crime has a minimum and maximum wanted level. When you commit a crime, you will receive at least the minimum wanted level for that crime. If you are already above that threshold, then you will receive one wanted level instead, but it's capped at the maximum wanted level.

## Violent Crimes
Some crimes are defined as *violent*. According to the [rules](/rules/full#part-two-police-officers), officers are allowed to shoot and kill a suspect who has committed a violent crime in their presence, or it was committed very recently and they received information about it.
