# Cops and Robbers V Wiki

Cops and Robbers V (formerly known as GTA Cops and Robbers, GTA CnR, or simply CnR) is a [GTA V](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v) multiplayer server operated and developed by [Sasinosoft Games](https://sasinosoft.com/). It is based on the [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) platform. CnR V is not an RP server, as roleplaying is not part of the gameplay and isn't required, but you can play as a police officer, a criminal or a variety of other jobs.

## Gameplay

### Kill players without getting banned
- [**Know the rules!**](https://gtacnr.net/full_rules): Knowing the rules is the best way to avoid all bans 👍 
- **Defense of Life**: Engage in combat when your life or your friends' lives are in immediate danger.
- **Players with Bounties**: Engaging in combat is always allowed against players who have bounties on their heads (not for EMS).
- **Kills in Revenge**: Combat is permissible when you're a **civillian** seeking revenge against players who have previously attacked you or cops who have arrested you. to make sure you're allowed to kill that player, type in chat /revenge (in non-hardcore servers you will find a red ring around the player's blip in map).
- **Defense of Property**: Combat is allowed to protect your property from theft, damage, or trespassing (only if you're a civillian).
- **Provoking and Competing Players**: Combat is permissible when players provoke or interfere with your objectives within reasonable limits (only if you're a civillian).
- **Players in Marked Redzones**: Combat is allowed within marked redzones, but avoid chasing players outside these areas without valid reason (only if you're a civillian).
- **Cops Working Against You**: Engage in combat for self-defense or revenge against law enforcement officers, but avoid random attacks (only if you're a civillian).
- **Paramedics Working Against You**: Combat is justified if paramedics revive or heal enemies, but avoid attacking random paramedics without cause (only if you're a civillian).

### Keybinds
Keybinds play a crucial role in enhancing your gameplay efficiency and response time in CnR. This guide will provide you with two methods to set keybinds: through the Interaction Menu (M key) and the Console (F8 key). 

Interaction Menu (M Key):
| Press the M key to open the Interaction Menu.
| Navigate to "Options" and select "Hotkeys."
| Assign a specific keybind to each action by selecting the corresponding key (1 to 10) and choosing the desired actions.
| Experiment with different keybinds to find what works best for your playstyle.
By default, these binds will be at keyboard 1 to 0, but you can change each of them in the Pause Menu > Settings > Key Bindings > FiveM > (gtacnr) Hotkey 

Console (F8 Key):
| Press the F8 key to open the Console.
| Use the command *`bind keyboard [key] "command"`* to assign a keybind. For example, *`bind keyboard J "equip weapon_stungun"`* binds the key J to equip the Stun Gun.
| Test the keybind in-game to ensure it functions as intended.
| To unbind a key, use the command *`unbind keyboard [key]`*
