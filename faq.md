# Frequently Asked Questions

#### Is this a roleplay server?
No, Cops and Robbers V is a "CnR" server, a type of server where players can be cops, criminals or other roles, without requiring the player to act realistically.

Some features might be RP-like, but overall the server is not meant to recreate a realistic roleplay environment, even though it's completely fine to do so with your friends.

The server has RPG components, such as the XP & Level system, and level-locked content, that require the player to grind in order to rise, level up and get that exclusive content.
